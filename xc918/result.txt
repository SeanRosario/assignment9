Visually inspect the graphs generated in question 7 and write a short description of the changes you observe over the period. Place your description in a file called 
\f2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
results.txt
\f3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

\fs24 Answer:\
From 2007 to 2012, by looking at the shape from box plots, the distribution did not change dramatically and plots show that Africa still remains the lowest and European countries keep being the richest level. Meanwhile, the richest group shifts from European to Asian after 2010, but the outliers show that European is the richest. . Moreover, no region increases or decreases monotonically. \
