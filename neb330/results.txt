Overall there is not a large variation between the GDP for each country over the five years.
The poorer countries (Africa, Oceania and South America) have decreasing GDP between
2007 and 2012. Oceania has the greatest decrease in GDP between 2011 and 2012.
From the stacked histogram we can see that in the in the poorer countries, the 
income per person becomes a bit more uniform across the income levels. We see less people
making under $10,000 per year between 2007 and 2010. We cannot necessarily see that
in the box plots.
