From the histograms I observed that from 2007 to 2012, there is an increase of gdp or there is an increase of people
with higher income. Changes are relatively small in Asia, while in Europe and South America and there are more obvious
changes.

I observed from the boxplots that gdp in Europe is higher than other continents with greater range. In Asia, range in
income is big but average is relatively low, which might suggest a big income gap in Asia.
