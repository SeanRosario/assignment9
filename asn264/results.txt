The distribution of wealth in Africa, South America, and Oceania seems to be relatively unchanged, though the two former regions seem slightly more wealthy in later years than in 2007, and Oceania has a noticeably smaller range in 2012 than in earlier years. 

Asia became generally wealthier since the mean of the boxplot is greater in 2007 than in 2012. In addition, the value for the third quartile and the value of outliers also appears to have increased, suggesting that there are a few very high income nations making the average value higher, rather than an overall, equal increase across all nations in Asia. 

In Europe, the average income dropped significantly as did the number of higher outliers. The data suggests that the region is generally less wealthy in 2012 than it was in 2007. However, it seems that the tail of the distribution is still relatively long. 

In North America, the distribution of income is similar except that there seem to be more countries with high income, but some of those countries are generally less wealthy - that is, the outliers and higher values are not as large as before. In the boxplots, this is reflected by generally higher means but smaller ranges in later years.
