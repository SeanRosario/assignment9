Program Description: assignment9 is the main module from which the program is run. 
It loads the required data frames as necessary, formats them appropriately, 
and then allows the user to enter a year in order to display a histogram of
the income distribution. Once the user types "finish", it generates histograms
and boxplots of the income distribution by region for the years 2007-2012 into pdf files.

Testing: unit-testing for the utilities module and the regionalGDP class are provided 
in test_utilities and test_regionalGDP respectively.
