1. Range of Oceania has decreased slightly from 2007 to 2012. 

2. The higher outlier of Africa has reduced significantly.

3. The income of Asia is lower in 2012 than 2007. Although the right tail has been at a relatively high level.

4. The average income and third quantile of income in Europe decreased significantly. This might imply tha this region is less wealthy in 2012 than it was in 2007 in general. However, similar to Asia, the right tail remains at the highest level.
