I observed the period from 1950 to 2010 with a 10-year intervel. There are several changes.

The first one is that the income distribution tends to shift to right, which implies that the number of people have higher income is increasing during this period.

Second, the maximum income increases from  80,000 to 90,000. But it does not increase monotonically. At first, it drops to 60,000 and then it grows to 90,000.

Third, the number of people with lower income(below 10,000) decreases from 1950 to 2010. The change has similar pattern as the change of maximum income, but in a inverse way. It increases at first, then it drops to a lower level.
