Making an examination of the Medians in the boxplots, we see that:
- For Asia, there is a constant growth between 2007 and 2012.
- For Europe, we can observe that the median decreases in the year 2009, but again starts to grow in 2010.
- For Africa, as the region in Asia, it presents a constant growth in the period.
- For North America, occurs the same as in Europe, there is a decrease in 2009, but grows again in 2010.
- For South America, the region presents no decrease in any year.
- For Oceania, it presents a constant decrease in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011, starting to grow again in 2012.

We can make an assumption of the relationship between the North America and Europe. Both presented the the same decrease
in the same year. This could be seen as the tight bounds in their economy.
For the other regions, with exception of Oceania, we can see that there is a constant growth through the years.
