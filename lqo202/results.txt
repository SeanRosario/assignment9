In Africa in the six year period evaluated, the distribution is almost the same. However it is possible to see that there are more outliers in the last years (from a limit in the box plot of 16,000 to almost 18,000), moving the distribution a bit. This values do not change too much the distribution because the majority of people have not changed, the median has almost no moved. 
The trend in Europe and Oceania is not clear, in some years it comes up, in other it goes down. However the upper tail seem to keep growing, even tough it does not affect much of the overall distribution.
In SouthAmerica the trend seems to be possitive, in the last 3 years displayed by the data, the histogram starts from 4000, when years before it stated at 2000. This shows a jump in the distribution.
NorhtAmerica in the last 3 years the distribution instead of jumping to higher values, has become more skewed. This means that more people are starting to earn more, but the income has reached a point that is difficult to increment.
The situation of the income seems to have two sides, the first one is of the regions that have the called third world countries, that seem to be growing by jumping to higher values. On the other hand even when the distributions in the other regions has not jumped too much, the distribution has been concentratin in higher values.
