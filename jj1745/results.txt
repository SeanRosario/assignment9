Answer for question 9:

After we go through different years from 1800 to 2012, we can see that there is a clear trend in increase of income per capita through years. In 1800 most countries have income per capita at a level of 500, whereas in 2000 this value increases to about 5000. Some countries have been growing significantly during this period, reaching a level over 50000. These outliers seem to be rather stable during the last 10 years, indicating the largest economies of the world are still the leaders.
