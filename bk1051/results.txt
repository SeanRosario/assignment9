Between 2007 and 2012, incomes per capita went down in Europe, but went up in Asia and South America. The changes were more modest in North America and Africa. In Oceana, the range of incomes went down dramatically, as the economies moved closer together.

In Africa and Asia, it seems some countries in the bottom of the income spectrum have moved into the middle, while in North America and Europe, the predominant trend seems to be countries in the middle of the spectrum getting richer.
