When looking at the individual region histograms, we can see that Africa and Oceania's income distributions didn't change much over the time frame. North America was also pretty constant, although the data clustered together in the middle a little more towards the end of the time frame. South America didn't change much either, although the higher end of the distribution increased slightly over the 6 years. In Asia income disparity got more extreme. The country with the highest income had an increase in mean income over the 6 years. The rest of the countries, which had much lower incomes to begin with, either stayed the same or slightly decreased. In 2012, Europe's income distribution devolatized. The higher income levels and lower income levels moved closer to the middle.

In looking at the boxplots, it seems that the regions with emerging markets, Asia and South America, had income distributions that become more volatile over the 6 years as the whiskers of the two plots covered a wider range in 2012 than they did in 2007, as well as the upper outliers having increasing income. On the other hand, North America and Europe had income distributions that devolatized. The whiskers covered a smaller range in 2012 than they did in 2007. Africa and Oceania had distributions that stayed pretty constant during the 6 years.
