What we see in the charts is that the number of countries with very low GDP Per Capita, less than $20,000 per year, has been decreasing from 2007 to 2012.  Also, the boxplots show that the Per Capita GDP by region has changed very little from 2007 to 2012, so what this tells us is that even though a small number of countries have moved out of the lowest threshold of Per Capita GDP, but they have not increaseed their Per Capita GDP enough to dramatically change the distribution per region.
